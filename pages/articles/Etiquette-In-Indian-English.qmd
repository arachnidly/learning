**Introduction**

Etiquette, a concept deeply embedded in the norms of polite behaviour and social conduct, generally assumes very peculiar manifestations when it gets adapted to the setting of different cultures. The way Indians have interpreted etiquette in the English language sometimes differs from traditional Western understanding. This article will draw on the specifics of this change, helping to illustrate how Indian English etiquette in and of itself is a reflection of both cultural diversity and historical influence.

**Historical Context and Colonial Influence**

The understanding of etiquette in India has been radically structured through its colonial history. Due to British dominion, English was cultivated as the language of administration and education, and so too were Western notions of etiquette naturalised into the culture. However, these ideas were adapted to the local context. For instance, the British would teach formal greetings and rigid table manners; Indian versions included aspects of their tradition such as foot touching to show reverence or dining as a group. These integrations of culture showed how colonial influences found ways into India's pre-established culture, which uniquely in that process developed a version of etiquette that would be characteristically Indian [(Tinkham, 1993)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-971X.1993.tb00024.x).

**Politeness and Hierarchical Respect**

Politeness in Indian English is richly contributed to by the respect accorded to hierarchy and age. An elder, even informally, would always be addressed as "Sir" or "Madam." Similarly, this kind of respect can also be seen at workplaces, where everybody from top to bottom is properly treated and maintained with a level of formality. On the other hand, Western etiquette may be more concerned with principles of equality and, at times, bluntness, which can become unresolvable conflicts when these cultural norms intersect. For example, in their research, [Tinkham](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-971X.1993.tb00024.x) points out that Westernised Indians use phrases such as "thank you" and "I'm sorry" more than do the less Westernised ones. Clearly, there appears to be a need for understanding the cultural context in which language is used. It plays a very important role in communication and interactions between social beings.

**Communication Styles**

Indian English etiquette can also be seen in communication styles. Indirectness is often preferred due to the desire not to face or cause confrontation and disharmony. Polite methods that a person might refuse include "I will try" or "Let's see," with such phrases expressing refusal or unverifiability. In Western society, where directness is respected, this would be considered evasiveness. This tendency towards ambiguity may give rise to misinterpretations, in which politeness in one culture seems ambiguous to others [(Kurchenkova, Palashevskaya, & Kurchenkova, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20196900069). Understanding these differences is essential to effective cross-cultural communication, as it leads to a lack of confusion and gives room for a more respectful and empathetic interaction.

**Hospitality and Guest Relations**

Hospitality stands as a foundation of Indian culture, which can be mirrored by Indian English etiquette. Guests are considered with due respect and care, often with elaborate displays of hospitality. More than common polite invitations, sentences like "Please come," and "You must have tea" reveal firm expectations. Western etiquette, on the other hand, might see such insistence as too much on the guest, which goes to show that there is a cultural difference in hosting and guest relations. This focus on hospitality really exemplifies the Indian value of treating guests as gods, a concept that dates back to the traditional saying "Atithi Devo Bhava."

**The Role of Apologies**

Apologies in Indian English etiquette have a much more discreet role than in Western etiquette. The tradition of saying "sorry" often, even for quite small inconveniences, is a strategy to maintain social harmony and show care towards others. In Western cultures, apologies tend to be more sparing, and they are often reserved to show awareness of important mistakes. This may sometimes lead to confusion where frequent apologies indicate the weakness of a person in certain respects, not so much politeness [(Bharuthram, 2003)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-2166(03)00047-X). It is for this very reason that the difference in culture with regard to behaviour such as an apology has great significance placed on context and indicates the possibility of cross-cultural misunderstanding in relation to the particular aspect of concern.

**Adapting to Global Standards**

The more India integrates with the global community, there is an acute awareness of the need to balance traditional etiquette with global standards. This will hopefully allow for a more direct approach to workplace communication, whereby a better understanding is gained regarding the subtleties of Western manners. Equally as important are the efforts that need to be put in place to preserve those qualities of Indian etiquette that bring value and richness to interpersonal encounters and best reflect the cultural heritage of this country. It is in negotiating this fine balance that Indians who operate in a global environment ensure that they retain their cultural identity.

**Conclusion**

Indian English etiquette is an interesting juxtaposition of traditional Indian values and colonial influences, adapted to contemporary life. Even as it might contrast with Western notions of politeness, there is deep respect, hospitality, and harmony in it. Understanding such differences is crucial for improving interaction and mutual respect between people in the globalising world. By appreciating unique expressions of etiquette across cultures, we are in a much better position to navigate social interactions with greater awareness.
